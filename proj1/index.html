<h4>How to rasterize triangles</h4>
<p>
    Given the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle, we iterate over
    every pixel in the rectangle bounding box of the triangle, check if that
    pixel lies within the bounds using the three line test, and color it in the
    sample buffer if it does.
</p>

<h4>Efficiency</h4>
<p>
    In the naive implementation of our triangle rasterization algorithm, we 
    first find the coordinates of bounding box by finding the min x, y and max 
    x, y coordinates among the three coordinates of the traingle's vertices.
    Then, we iterate only over the pixels within this bounding box and apply
    the three line test to them. Thus, our algorithm is no worse than one that
    checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle

<h4>Supersampling - Overview</h4>
<p>
    Instead of sampling only once per pixel, our supersampling algorithm samples
    multiple times per pixel, horizontally and vertically, according to the sample
    rate. The color at each sample is recorded in the high-resolution sample buffer,
    which is eventually downsampled into the framebuffer using average pooling.
</p>

<h4> Why Supersampling is Useful</h4>
<p>
    Supersampling allows us to account for colors present in different sections
    within a pixel, providing a clear advantage over regular sampling which only
    considers one point per pixel.
</p>

<h4>Modifications to the Rasterization Pipeline</h4>
<p>
    To modify our rasterization pipeline to support supersampling, we first changed
    methods <i>set_sample_rate</i> and <i>fill_pixel</i> to factor in the sample rate
    to calculate the new buffer size. Then, we tweaked <i>rasterize_line</i> to
    rasterize each pixel <i>sample_rate</i> times in the sample buffer (as the sample
    color because lines don't need to be antialised), and changed <i>rasterize_triangle</i>
    to record the colors of <i>sample_rate</i> equally separated subpixels within
    each pixel into the sample buffer. Finally, we updated method <i>resolve_to_framebuffer</i>
    to average pool each group of <i>sample_rate</i> sample buffer pixels into 
    one framebuffer pixel.
</p>

<h4>Supersampling for Antialising</h4>
<p>
    When we downsample our supersamples using average pooling, we account for the
    ratios of different colors present within each pixel, enabling antialising.
</p>

<h4>Alternate Antialising Methods</h4>
<p>In addition, we also attempted to super sample using random sampling within a single pixle.
    We have created a seperate function "rasterize_triangle_random_supersampling" and tested it out by calling it in place of the regular restarized_triangle.
    However, despite the reduction of jaggies, for some reason the color was a bit off.
    Here is a side by side comparison of a rendered image with sapling rate set to 16: </p>
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/random.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Random super-sampling with rate 16</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/regular.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption align="middle">Regular super-sampling with rate 14</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
    </table>
    <p>Clearly, we can see that there is an obvious reduction in jaggies, but the color was much lighter.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
  <p>The Barycentric coordinates describes a point's relationship with the triangle that it resides in.
    The Barycentric coordinate of a point (x, y) is expressed as (a, b, c), where a + b + c = 1 and Aa + Bb + Cc = (x, y),
    where A, B, C are the coordinates of the three vertices that surrounds (x, y).
    (a, b, c) can be interpreted as the proportion of each vertex A, B, and C shares with (x, y). It is commonly used in texture mapping,
    where given a triangle, we can use the Barycentric coordinates of each pixel within the triangle to determine what texture the pixel should have.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following image shows a simple example for barycentric coordinates. Each vertex in the triangle has a different color,
    and we can create this ombre effect by calculating the barycentric coordinates of each pixel within the triangle,
    and color the pixel using weighted sum of the color of the three coordinates, where the weights are the barycentric coordinates.

    Here is a color circle rendered using barycentric coordinates:

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<h4>Pixel Sampling - Overview</h4>
<p>
    Pixel sampling refers to representing an image by taking point samples at
    unit distances. To perform texture mapping, we wrote our pixel sampling method to
    iterate over pixels in the original image, find their corresponding coordinates
    in the texture map, then sample from the associated location in the texture
    map.
</p>

<h4>Nearest vs Bilinear Sampling</h4>
<p>
    Nearest sampling returns the color of the pixel closest to the given sample,
    wherest bilinear sampling computes the color as a linear combination of the colors
    of the four closest pixels, weighted by their distance to the sample. The 
    difference is that nearest sampling is faster due to its single memory access
    while bilinear sampling is more accurate as it accounts for the colors of more
    neighboring pixels.
</p>

      <td>
        <img src="images/test1_n1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

        <figcaption align="middle">nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/test1_b1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/test1_b16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>
    Visually, nearest sampling appears to be more choppy than bilinear sampling.
    This is indicative of the fact that bilinear sampling performs much better
    than nearest sampling when an image has granular details with multiple colors
    within each pixel.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
  <p>
    Level sampling is an optimization method that deals with the case where the sampling frequency in screen space is very different from the sampling frequency in texture space.
    When the screen space is very small compared to the texture space (for example when we shrink the image down to only one pixel), it is inefficient to generate a high resoluted image.
    Therefore, we generate a higher leveled image with a coarser level of detail, in order to reduce rendering complexity. The higher the level, the lower the resolution of the generated image.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way we determine which level the image should be, we compute the sampling frequency by first taking a point (x, y) in the screen space,
    and look at its right and upper neighbor pixel, (x+1, y) and (x, y+1) and how far these three pixels are from each other in the texture space.
    The way we measure how far they are from each other is by first computing the barycentric coordinates of the three points,
    and then using the barycentric coordinates to compute the distance that the two neighboring points have against the original point in the texture space using Pythagorean theorem.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implemented two level sampling methods: bi-linear sampling and nearest sampling.
    For nearest sampling, we look at the two distances we calculated, take the maximum, round it to the nearest integer and make it our level number, and sample using that level map.
    For bi-linear sampling, we look at the two distances we calculated, take the maximum, and take a weighted sum of each sample from the two sandwiching level maps.
  </p>
  <p>Blow are some different combination of level sampling and point sampling methods. On the right corner you can see the zoomed in image in detail.</p>
